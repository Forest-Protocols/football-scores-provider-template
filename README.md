## ‚öΩÔ∏è Description

**Predict Football Match Outcomes and Earn Tokens!**

This protocol enables Providers to offer football match score prediction services. Providers can predict outcomes of upcoming football fixtures across various leagues, with predictions made at different time intervals before the match (`T7D`, `T36H`, `T12H`, `T1H`, `T1M`). The protocol supports `1X2` market predictions (Home Win/Draw/Away Win).

List of supported leagues: `Premier League`, `La Liga`, `Bundesliga`, `Serie A`, `Ligue 1`, `Primeira Liga`, `EFL Championship` and `MLS`

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Prediction Score | Providers must submit probability distributions (p.h, p.d, p.a) for each match outcome. The Ranked Probability Score (RPS) is calculated by comparing these probabilities against the actual outcome (home/draw/away). The final score is calculated as `Math.round((1 - rps) * 100)`, resulting in a score between 0 and 100. |
| Response Time    | Maximum allowed time to generate predictions for a batch of fixtures. Must be under 12 seconds to ensure timely predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Availability     | Service uptime requirement. Providers must maintain 99.9% availability to ensure reliable prediction service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## üèÜ Scoring System Details

The prediction scoring system uses the Ranked Probability Score (RPS) formula to evaluate the quality of probability predictions:

1. For each match, providers submit three probabilities:

   - p.h: Probability of home win
   - p.d: Probability of draw
   - p.a: Probability of away win

2. The actual outcome is recorded as:

   - o: "home", "draw", or "away"

3. The RPS is calculated and then transformed into a final score:

   ```javascript
   finalScore = Math.round((1 - rps) * 100);
   ```

4. This results in a score between 0 and 100, where:
   - Higher scores indicate better predictions
   - A perfect prediction would score 100
   - A completely incorrect prediction would score 0

## üöÄ Become a Provider in this Protocol

In order to compete in Forest you need a Forest Provider Daemon running and serving predictions when a Validator asks for them. There are two ways to integrate:
1. [*streamlined*] **You expose an API and use one of the Gateway Providers** First step: expose your model's predictions via an API compatible with this Protocol's schema. Second step: Register yourself as a Virtual Provider using ForestAI's CLI. Instructions available here: [link](docs/become-a-virtual-provider.md). 
2. [*full integration*] **You run the Daemon yourself**. Take this repo and follow these [instructions](docs/become-a-provider.md). A little longer process but full ownership and control.
